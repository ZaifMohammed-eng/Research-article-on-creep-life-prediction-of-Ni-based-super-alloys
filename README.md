Predicting the creep rupture life of Nickel-based superalloys is inherently complex due to the variability in its formation mechanisms, which depend on factors such as material composition, microstructure, stress, and temperature. Traditional models often struggle to capture these non-linear relationships, necessitating advanced predictive approaches. This study leverages machine learning techniques to predict creep rupture life using 21 physical properties, including alloy composition, operating conditions (σ and T), and microstructural parameters (δ, Xγ′, Dγ) derived via CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) modeling with TC-Python. Among various classical machine learning models evaluated, Gradient Boosting Regression (GB) was selected for its superior predictive accuracy, effectively modeling the complex, non-linear dependencies inherent in creep behavior. To interpret the GB model’s predictions, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were utilized to quantify the contribution of each property, revealing Ti, σ, T, Dγ, Xγ′, δ, and Cr as the dominant features influencing creep life, with low Ti and Cr concentrations, high δ, and high W enhancing creep life, while high σ, T, Dγ, and Xγ′ reduce it. Features such as Co, Al, Mo, Fe, Mn, and C show moderate influence, while Zr, Ta, Nb, Cu and Hf have minimal impact. Numerical Sensitivity Analysis (NSA), conducted by perturbing features by 10% of their range, further reveals that increasing alloying element concentrations (except Ti) improves creep life, whereas σ and T interactions significantly diminish it. Microstructural parameters Xγ′ and δ enhance creep resistance, while Dγ negatively impacts it. Key interactions, such as those between σ, T, alloying elements, and microstructural parameters provide actionable insights for optimization, with NSA heatmaps highlighting independent alloying element effects to facilitate design. This integrated methodology enhances prediction accuracy and provides practical strategies for optimizing alloy compositions and microstructural properties, advancing the development of Nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature applications such as turbine blades, with further interaction studies recommended.
